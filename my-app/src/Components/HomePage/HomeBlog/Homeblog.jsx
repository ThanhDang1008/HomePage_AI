          We love A.I. and welcome you to our AI blog. There is so much going on
          in the field of AI and our goal is to keep you up-to-date in
          innovative, informative, and entertaining ways. We see this website as
          a form of digital art as all images and text were generated by
          artificial intelligence (with a little bit of human help). This AI
          blog is written and designed by impressive AIs, and humans merely
          perform copy & paste operations - we showcase the progress of AI
          capabilities on all fronts (text, image, video, audio, design,
          technology, education, etc).

          E-Commerce Video Mockups with Hedra
        </a>
        <p className="block_footer-text">
          Using Hedraâ€™s generative video AI, we created compelling e-commerce
          video mockups, finding that the technology excels when focusing on
          facial features but struggles with upper or full-body shots, leading
          to less realistic results.
